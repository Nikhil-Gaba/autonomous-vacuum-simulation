# autonomous-vacuum-simulation

•	Designed a grid-based simulation in Python where an autonomous agent (“Vacuuminator”) navigates a 2D world with walls and dirt patches. 
•	Developed functions to compute Manhattan distances to walls and nearby dirt patches using coordinate detection and directional scanning.
•	Implemented logic for legal movement within grid constraints, avoiding collisions with walls and boundaries.
•	Used modular design with reusable components for environment updating, sensor simulation, and decision-making.
•	Gained experience in algorithmic thinking, control flow, and data structures (lists and tuples).
